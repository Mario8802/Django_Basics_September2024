This repository includes hands-on projects focusing on:

Creating and configuring Django projects from scratch
Implementing Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture
Setting up URL routing, views, and templates

Projects
URLs and Views: A project demonstrating how to set up URL routing and corresponding views in Django, located in the urls_and_views/ folder.

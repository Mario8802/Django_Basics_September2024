# Django Basics - September 2024

Welcome to the **Django Basics** repository, which contains projects and exercises from my learning journey through the **Django Basics** course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4391/django-basics-january-2024#lesson-65475). The goal of this repository is to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts using the Django framework.

- Creating and configuring Django projects from scratch
- Implementing Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture
- Setting up URL routing, views, and templates
- Managing static files like CSS and JavaScript
- Structuring projects for scalability and efficiency

### Projects

- **URLs and Views**: A project demonstrating how to set up URL routing and corresponding views in Django, located in the `urls_and_views/` folder.
- **Static Files and Templates**: An example of managing static files and rendering templates with dynamic content in Django.
